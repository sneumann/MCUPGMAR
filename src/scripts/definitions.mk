# sh pipe exit code forwarding workaround: 
# Normally, in sh shell when one program in the pipeline exits abnormally, you would not know, since you only 
# get the exit code of the last program. This macro will run an sh command to check if some program in the 
# pipeline has exited abnormally. 
# It checks the exit status of all piped programs in the last invocation of sh commandline in foreground
# by using the sh PIPESTATUS array variable.
#
# double $'s are used to escape $'s from makefile interpretation
# sh doesn't like two consecutive ';'  marks, so don't use one after this macro.
#
# example for usage:
# echo hello | tr e a | exit101 | tr a e  > $@.tmp  ; $(CHECK_PIPE_EXIT_CODES) mv -vf $@.tmp $@
# where exit1 is:
# 1:#!/bin/sh
# 2:cat
# 3:exit 101
# will fail with a 101 exit code and will not reach the mv statement
